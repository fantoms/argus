<H1>Extended Service Tests</H1>

<DIV CLASS=TECHNOTE>
Extended testing support was added in version 3.2
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS=TECHNOTE>
Extended testing is an advanced feature. If you are just starting out with argus
it is recommended that you stick to the standard built-in service tests as
described in <A HREF="services.html">services</A>
</DIV>

<P>In previous versions, most services could be tested only with an
<TT>expect</TT> regular expression, except for SNMP tests which could
have minimum or maximum value tests, etc.</P>

<P>Now, most services (those places where it makes sense) can use
all of the tests that used to be available only for SNMP. Such as</P>
<UL>
	<LI>	<B>expect</B>	- a regular expression to expect
	<LI>	<B>nexpect</B>	- a regular expression to not expect
	<LI>	<B>eqvalue</B>	- value must be equal to this
	<LI>	<B>nevalue</B>	- value must not be equal to this
	<LI>	<B>minvalue</B>	- value must be this or more
	<LI>	<B>maxvalue</B>	- value must be this or less
</UL>

<P>There are also several pre-processing and calculations
that can be performed before testing</P>
<UL>
	<LI>	<B>pluck</B>	- a regular expression used to pull a value out of some content.
	<LI>	<B>unpack</B>	- an unpack expression to pull a value from a binary packet
	<LI>	<B>calc</B>	- perform a calculation, such as averaging, or rate
	<LI>	<B>scale</B>	- apply a scale factor
</UL>
<P>for example</P>
<PRE>
	Service TCP {
		uname:		disk-space
		messagedn:	/home is nearly full
		port:		6543
		send:		/home
		pluck:		\s(\d+)%
		maxvalue:	90
	}
	Service UDP/NTP {
		uname:		dispersion
		messagedn:	clock has drifted too far
		unpack:		x8 N
		scale:		65536
		maxvalue:	2
	}
	Service UDP/DNS/Serial/example.com {
		minvalue:	2002010100
		maxvalue:	2004123100
	}
</PRE>


<h2>Aberrant Behavior Detection</h2>
<p>Services can be checked for values outside of 
the predicted range using <a href="hwab.html">Holt Winters</a></p>

<H2>Graphing</H2>
<P>All services which can make use of the extended tests can have the
resulting value graphed. See the documentation on 
<a href="graphing.html">graphing</a>.</P>
