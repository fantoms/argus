<H1>Bugs</H1>
<P>
There are no known bugs in the current version of argus.
</P>

<H1>Perl Issues</H1>
<P><B>5.8.1</B> - it is expected that certain configurations of perl 5.8.1 will
cause older versions of argus to fail. Using an older version of perl
or newer version of argus is recommended.</P>

<P><B>5.8.0</B>	- the default configuration of perl 5.8.0 has 'perlio'
enabled. On several OSes, perlio has "issues", both performance-wise,
and memory-wise. Argus will run, but memory use and CPU use can become
excessive. Compiling perl to not use perlio, or using another version
of perl is recommended.</P>

<P><B>5.6.0</B>	- there is bug in perl's syslog module on some OSes,
which can cause argus to fail if syslog is enabled. Disabling syslog
or using another version of perl is recommended.</P>
