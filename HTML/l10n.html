<H1>Argus in your Language</H1>

<P><DIV CLASS=TECHNOTE>
Localization support was added in version 3.3
</DIV></P>

<P>Argus has the ability to display its web pages in the language of
your choice. Argus ships with support for several languages, and
support for additional languages can be easily added.</P>


<H2>Configuring</H2>
<P>
When displaying web pages, the argus cgi program uses the language
value set in the config file (lang), or set in the environment, and uses that to load a file.</P>
<P>
The cgi program checks the environment variables <B>LC_ALL</B>,
<B>LC_ARGUS</B>, and then <B>LANG</B>, in order and uses the first one
it finds. If none are set, it uses the value <TT>default</TT>.
Often, one of these environment variables will already be set correctly.</P>

<P>
It then looks in the directory <TT>$datadir/locale</TT> for a file
by that name. If it cannot load the specified file, it will use english.</P>
<P>
So, to configure your language of choice, you have 3 options:</P>

<OL>
<LI>add a line to your argus config like:<PRE>
    lang: en_us
</PRE>
<LI>adjust the environment variables to match the correct filename.
the variable will need to be set before starting your web server.
how exactly to set environment variables for your web server is beyond
the scope of this document.

<LI>adjust the name of the file in <TT>$datadir/locale</TT> to match what
argus is looking for (either to the environment variable that is already configured
or the value <TT>default</TT>). you can either rename or symlink the correct
file to the desired name.

</OL>


<H2>Adding a new language</H2>
<P>
If there is not currently support for the language you want to use,
it is fairly simple to add a new language.
</P>
<P>In the <TT>$datadir/locale</TT> you will find a file called <TT>template</TT>.
Copy this file to a new file, and load it into your favorite editor.
Following the instructions and examples contained in the file, enter the
words and phrases correct for your language.</P>
<P>Follow the instructions above to get argus to use your new file.</P>
<P>Send your file to the author so it may be included in the next version.</P>
