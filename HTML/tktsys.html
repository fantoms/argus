<h1>Ticket System Integration</h1>


<DIV CLASS=TECHNOTE>
Ticket system support was added in version 3.7
</DIV>

<p>Argus can attach overrides to your trouble ticket system,
in order to:</p><ol>
<li>make sure something isn't overridden without opening a trouble
ticket
<li>remove an override once a ticket is closed
</ol>

<ul>
<li><span class=param>tkt_check_url</span>
the url to check the status of a ticket. 
<b>TICKET</b> will be replaced with the ticket number.<br>
eg. <span class=example>http://tkt.example.com/tktview?t=TICKET</span>

<li><span class=param>tkt_check_expect</span>
a string that will be returned if the ticket is open.<br>
eg. <span class=example>OPEN</span>

<li><span class=param>tkt_view_url</span>
the url to view a ticket. 
<b>TICKET</b> will be replaced with the ticket number.<br>
eg. <span class=example>http://tkt.example.com/tktview?t=TICKET</span>

<p>once configured, argus will ask for the ticket number
when an override is installed.</p>
