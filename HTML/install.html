        <UL>

        <LI>    <P><TT>perl</TT><BR>
                the software has been tested with 5.6.1 and should work
                with most other versions of perl 5 as well.<BR>
		Find perl at <A HREF="http://www.perl.org">www.perl.org</A></P>

		<P>Note: there are issues with some versions of perl on some operating systems,
		see <A HREF="bugs.html">bugs.html</A> for additional details.</P>


        <LI>    <P><TT>sendmail</TT> and <TT>qpage</TT>
                are recommended. either or both can be used to send
                notifications.<BR>
		Find sendmail at <A HREF="http://www.sendmail.org">www.sendmail.org</A><BR>
		Find qpage at <A HREF="http://www.qpage.org">www.qpage.org</A></P>

		<P>Note: this does not need to be the real sendmail, as long
		as it looks and smells like sendmail. ie. <TT>qmail</TT>'s
		sendmail compatible <TT>sendmail</TT> program will be just fine.</P>

        <LI>    <P><TT>fping</TT> is used by the Ping Monitoring module
                for ping tests. While this is not required, it is
