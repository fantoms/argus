<H1>Security</H1>
<P>Argus does not need to run with any special permissions. It
can be run as an ordinary unprivileged user.</P>

<P>Normal UNIX file permissions should be set appropriately
on the "data" directory and on the "control" socket to prevent
access by un-authorized users.</P>

<P>Argus's internal acls only apply to access through the web interface.
Normal UNIX permissions apply to access directly to the "control" socket.</P>
