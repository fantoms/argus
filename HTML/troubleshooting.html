<TITLE>Argus - System and Network Monitoring Software - Troubleshooting</TITLE>
<!--#include file="top.shtml" -->

<H1>Troubleshooting</H1>
<P>At some point you may wonder why Argus thinks something
is down or up (perhaps you tested it manually and you disagree),
or why argus is doing such-and-such instead of other-such.</P>

<P>The <TT>debugging</TT> page contains all sorts of
information about the object in question, some of which
may be useful for a tech to troubleshoot issues (but beware,
this is no place for a PHB).</P>

<P>The meaning of some of the information will be obvious from its name
or from reading the configuration documentation, some won't be
obvious. Running <TT>argusd -E</TT> will generate some documentation
on the various parameters. Or find an
<A HREF="debug-details.html">auto-generated list here</A>.
In particular, you may find such things as: time of the
last test, time of the next test, the reason a test failed,
and the values argus is using for every configurable parameter.</P>

<P>Access to this information is controlled by 'acl_about'.
To minimize confusion of management and/or end-users, 
it is recommended that access only be given to technical staff
capable of understanding this information.</P>

<H2>Logging</H2>
<P>Argus will log various errors to its log file, located in the
data directory, or via the web page.</P>
<P>Argus will log even more things to syslog, if syslog is enabled in
the config file.
If you haven't enabled syslog, you can also get the detailed logs
using argusctl:</P>
<PRE>
	argusctl -k console
</PRE>
<P>The cgi program will log various errors to where ever your web server
logs such things, typically a file called 'error_log'.</P>


<H2>Service Debugging</H2>
<P>For detailed, real-time 'what is happening' info, you can set the
debugging flag on a service, this will send all sorts of data to
syslog:</P>
<PRE>
	Service UDP/SNMP {
		hostname:	cisco-1.example.com
		community:	qwerty
		oid:		.1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.13.1.3.1.3.1
		maxvalue:	27
		<FONT COLOR=red>debug:		yes</FONT>
	}
</PRE>

<P>You can also toggle the debugging flag at run-time using argusctl:</P>
<PRE>
argusctl setparam param=debug value=<FONT COLOR=red>1</FONT> object=Top:Servers:Ping_10.0.0.4
argusctl setparam param=debug value=<FONT COLOR=red>0</FONT> object=Top:Servers:Ping_10.0.0.4
</PRE>
