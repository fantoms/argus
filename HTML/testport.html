<H1>Test Port</H1>

<DIV CLASS=TECHNOTE>
The test port was added in version 3.3
</DIV>

<P>In order to remotely check that Argus is properly running,
you can enable the test server on a TCP port</P>
<PRE>
	test_port:	3074
</PRE>
<P>You should pick a port number over 1024 that is not currently in
use on the server argus is running on.</P>

</P>

<P>You can then check on it by telneting
to the test port:</P>
<PRE>
	telnet argus.example.com 3074

	Connected to argus.example.com.
	Escape character is '^]'.
	<FONT COLOR=blue>Argus running</FONT>
	Connection closed by foreign host.
</PRE>

<P>Or, you can configure a 'Service' monitor on another Argus:</P>
<PRE>
	Service TCP/Argus {
		hostname:	argus.example.com
		port:		3074
	}
</PRE>
