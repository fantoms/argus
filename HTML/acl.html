<TITLE>Argus - System and Network Monitoring Software - Access Control</TITLE>
<!--#include file="top.shtml" -->

<H1>Access Control</H1>
<P>In the users section we saw how to make a user a member of a set of
groups. In order to control access to things, we specify which groups
have access to a particular thing. If the user is a member of any of the
specified groups, access is permitted.</P>
<P>say we have a users file entry:</P>
<PRE>
	bob	xxYeIExOhgQJU	Top	gibber jabber
</PRE>
<P>bob now belongs to both the 'gibber' and 'jabber' groups.</P>
<PRE>
	Group "Foo" {
		acl_foobar:	jabber gizzle
		...
	}
</PRE>
<P>this gives all members of the groups 'jibber' and 'gizzle'
foobar permission. Thus, the user bob, being a member of 'jabber',
has foobar access.</P>

<DIV CLASS=TECHNOTE>
In most installations, the default access control lists
are sufficient, and you will not need to specify anything further.
</DIV>

<H2>Specifying Access Control Lists</H2>
<P>You can specify access control parameters on an object
in either of 2 modes: simple or extended.</P>
<P>In simple mode, there are 3 access control lists which control
all permissions:</P> <OL>
	<LI>	acl_user
	<LI>	acl_staff
	<LI>	acl_root
</OL>
<P>acl_user controls basic read access to an objects webpage.
acl_staff controls some read-write access, such as setting
or removing overrides, and acknowledging notifications.
acl_root controls everything else, such as accessing
debug info, and the configuration data.</P>
<P>Note, these are separate acls, controlling access to different things.
Argus will happily permit a user access to debugging info (acl_root) and
deny them access to view the webpage (acl_user). If you want to permit
a user access to everything, they will need to be in all 3 of the acls.
</P>
<H2>Simple Mode Defaults</H2>
<P>By default, if no acls are specified in the config file, argus
uses 3 groups named 'user', 'staff', and 'root' and creates acls:</P>
<PRE>
	acl_root:	root
	acl_staff:	staff root
	acl_user:	user staff root
</PRE>
<P>allowing you to assign one of these 3 groups to users in the users file</P>

<H2>Extended Mode</H2>
<P>In extended mode, each separate function has its own acl.</P>
<PRE>
	Group "Foo" {
		acl_mode:	extended
		acl_override:	staff
		acl_getconf:	sr_staff
		...
	}
</PRE>
<P>The acls are:</P><UL>
	<LI>	acl_page
	<LI>	acl_getconf
	<LI>	acl_about
	<LI>	acl_flush
	<LI>	acl_override
	<LI>	acl_annotate
	<LI>	acl_logfile
	<LI>	acl_ntfylist
	<LI>	acl_ntfyack
	<LI>	acl_ntfyackall
	<LI>	acl_ntfydetail
</UL>
<DIV CLASS=TECHNOTE>
In versions 3.5 and later, the acl_mode no longer needs to be specified,
and simple mode and extended mode parameters may be mixed and matched.
</DIV>

<H2>Cumulative Inheritance</H2>
<P>
ACLs are cumulative from the top level down.</P>
<PRE>
	Group "Foo" {
		acl_override:	foo

		Group "Bar" {
			acl_override:	bar
			...
		}
	}
</PRE>
<P>Members of both groups 'foo' and 'bar' will have override access
on 'Bar'.</P>
<P>
The syntax '-group' can be used to remove groups. The special '-ALL'
will remove all groups:</P>
<PRE>
	Group "Foo" {
		acl_override:	foo bar
		Group "Bar" {
			acl_override:	-foo baz
			...
		}
		Group "Baz" {
			acl_override:	-ALL baz
			...
		}
	}
</PRE>
