<TITLE>Argus - System and Network Monitoring Software - Users</TITLE>
<!--#include file="top.shtml" -->

<H1>Users File</H1>
<P>To control access, argus wants to know who is permitted to access what.
Associated with every valid user is:</P><UL>
<LI>	username
<LI>	password
<LI>	home object (like a unix home directory)
<LI>	list of access control groups
</UL>
<P>As distributed, argus gets this data from a text file called <TT>users</TT>
in the data directory.</P>

<DIV CLASS=TECHNOTE>
The code argus uses is designed to be modular and easily replaced
with other schemes for authentication. The source tarball comes
with a <TT>web_auth_prog</TT> file as an example of using an external
program to do this. The author is also aware of some sites that have
written code to query a SQL database.
</DIV>

<P>The format of the users file is:</P>
<PRE>
username  encrypted_password  home_obj  groups...
</PRE>
<P>as an example:</P>
<PRE>
anonymous       any             Top     user
joe		xraO.jc8wztJQ	Top	staff
bobby		UtDsk/kLoJ/HU	Top:Customers:YoYoDyne	yoyo
</PRE>

<P>
The password field is encrypted using your systems standard passwd
<TT>crypt()</TT> function. The special value <TT>any</TT> will permit
any password.
</P>

<P>
The home_object field specifies the name of the object for the
user's default page. This is what the user will see when they
first log in to argus. It is just like a unix home directory.
</P>
<DIV CLASS=TECHNOTE>
Also, just like a unix home directory, the user can do the equivalent
of <TT>cd ..</TT> to visit other pages. To prevent the user from seeing
other pages adjust the access control parameters appropriately.
</DIV>

<P>
The groups field is a white-space separated list of access control
groups. Access control groups are documented further somewhere else.
</P>
