<H1>Internal Workings</H1>

<P>normally the server sits around idle (blocked in select) until
  either a file descriptor becomes readable/writable or a timer
  goes off (a file descriptor timing out, a service scheduled to
  start a new test, or something scheduled via cron).</P>

  <H2>server - client</H2>
<P> clients (cgi and argusctl) can control and/or query the server
    via a control socket. connect, send commands, get responses.</P>

  <H2>select loop</H2>
<P> is at the heart of the server. all file descriptors of interest are
    BaseIO objects (subclasses). the objects maintain state indicating their desires
    for reading/writing/timeouts/etc. when one becomes readable/writable/
    or times out the object's appropriate handler function is dispatched.</P>

  <H2>web page generation</H2>
<P> since there are lots of objects and lots of web page 'hits' we do not
    want to generate web pages 'dumbly'. we generate a web page for an
    object only if a) it has changed since last time we generated it, and
    b) someone has requested it. we do not generate pages for objects that
    no one looks at, and do not generate pages for every 'hit'.</P>

  <H2>control</H2>
<P> over a unix domain socket. use the program 'argusctl'.
    the control functions are scattered throughout the code,
    and install themselves at runtime using 'command_install'</P>
