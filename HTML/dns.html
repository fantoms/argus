<H1>Extended DNS tests</H1>

<P><DIV CLASS=TECHNOTE><B>
Extended DNS testing support was added in version 3.2
</B></DIV></P>

<P><DIV CLASS=TECHNOTE>
Extended DNS testing is an advanced feature. If you are just starting out with argus,
or are not familiar with the inner workings of DNS
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt">[RFC 1035]</A>,
it is recommended that you stick to the standard built-in DNS tests as
described in <A HREF="services.html">services</A>
</DIV></P>

<P>It seems that there is no end to the creativity of people
mis-configuring DNS servers, or the number of failure modes
that exist in DNS servers.</P>
<P>The new DNS testing facility attempts to stay one step
ahead.</P>
<P>You can now specify any arbitrary DNS query, and perform
any number of tests on the response</P>

<P>In addition to all of the parameters for a typical UDP
test, the following can also be specified:</P>

<H2>Specifying a Query</H2>
<UL>
<LI>	<B>zone</B> - the DNS zone to query about
<LI>	<B>class</B> - the DNS class to query about. (typically <TT>IN</TT>)
<LI>	<B>recurse</B> - should the query be recursive
<LI>	<B>query</B> - the type of query. most standard queries are supported, including:
	<UL>
	<LI>	<B>A</B>	- ask for an address
	<LI>	<B>TXT</B>	- ask for text
	<LI>	<B>MX</B>	- ask for MX server
	<LI>	<B>NS</B>	- ask for name server
	<LI>	<B>SOA</B>	- ask for the start-of-authority data
	<LI>	<B>CNAME</B>	- ask for canonical name
	<LI>	<B>PTR</B>	- ask for ptr data
	<LI>	<B>STAT</B>	- perform a status query
	</UL>
</UL>
<P>for example:</P>
<PRE>
	Service UDP/DNS {
		zone:	example.com
		class:	IN
		query:	A
	}
</PRE>

<H2>Specifying a Test</H2>
<P>There are several different ways to test the response</P>
<UL>
<LI>	<B>none</B>	- up if we receive a response
<LI>	<B>noerror</B>	- up if the response is error free
<LI>	<B>authok</B>	- up if the response has the <TT>authoratative</TT> flag set
<LI>	<B>serial</B>	- perform an <A HREF="xtservices.html">extended test</A> on the serial number.
			<I>this only makes sense for SOA queries</I>
<LI>	<B>nanswers</B>	- perform an <A HREF="xtservices.html">extended test</A> on the number of answers
<LI>	<B>answer</B>	- perform an <A HREF="xtservices.html">extended test</A> on the answer itself
</UL>

<P>for example:</P>
<PRE>
	Service UDP/DNS {
		zone:	example.com
		class:	IN
		query:	MX
		test:	answer
		expect:	mail.example.com
	}
	Service UDP/DNS {
		zone:	  example.com
		class:	  IN
		query:	  SOA
		test:	  serial
		minvalue: 2002010100
		maxvalue: 2004123100
	}
	Service UDP/DNS {
		zone:	  example.com
		class:	  IN
		query:	  NS
		test:	  nanswers
		minvalue: 2
	}
</PRE>

<H2>Compatibility with Old DNS queries</H2>

<P>The syntax is backwards compatible with the DNS tests in previous versions.
So you can still say:</P>
<PRE>
	Service UDP/Domain/example.com
	Service UDP/DNSQ
	Service UDP/DNS
</PRE>
<P>The backwards compatible syntax is also extended slightly, so you can say things like:</P>
<PRE>
	Service UDP/DNS/NS/example.com {
		expect:		ns1.example.com
	}
	Service UDP/DNS/Serial/example.com {
		minvalue:	2002112000
	}
</PRE>
<P>Using the backwards compatible shorthand syntax will set
things to reasonable default values (such as <TT>class: IN</TT>
and <TT>test: answer</TT> or <TT>test: soa</TT>)</P>

<H2>Answer Format</H2>
<P>When testing the answer, the answer section of the response is decoded
into a textual format similar to the format of a DNS zone file or 
to the output of <TT>dig</TT>, and it may be multi-line if there is more than one
answer. For example:</P>
<PRE>
	www.example.com.  23h5m  IN   A    10.0.1.2
or
	example.com.      1d     IN   MX   10 mail1.example.com.
	example.com.      1d     IN   MX   20 mail2.example.com.
</PRE>
