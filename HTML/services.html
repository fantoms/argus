<TITLE>Argus - System and Network Monitoring Software - Services</TITLE>
<!--#include file="top.shtml" -->

<H1>Documentation - Services</H1>

<P>Services specify actual things to monitor. The very purpose of this
software. So, you'll probably need to know about them</P>

<P>In the config file, Services are specified as:</P>
<PRE>
	Service NAME {
		<I>data...</I>
	}
</PRE>
<P>Often, there will be no need to specify any data, and you may shorten
the specification to just</P><PRE>
	Service NAME
</PRE>

<DIV CLASS=TECHNOTE>
If you are just starting out with argus, it is recommended that you
stick to the short form when possible and let argus fill in the
default values. In most cases, you will only say:<BR>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service Ping</TT><BR>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service TCP/SMTP</TT><BR>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service TCP/IMAP</TT><BR>
in your config file, and argus will default the rest.
</DIV>

<P>NAME specifies the type of test. There are 4 main types of tests:</P><UL>
	<LI>	Ping	-	Pings a host
	<LI>	Prog	-	runs a program
	<LI>	TCP	-	tests a TCP port
	<LI>	UDP	-	tests a UDP port
</UL>
<P>Both TCP and UDP have a number of application tests built-in. Specifying an
application does the same thing as setting the various bits of data to values
appropriate for the protocol. But you could just as easily specify them directly.
</P>
<P>
The currently built-in application tests are:</P><UL>
	<LI>TCP/SMTP TCP/FTP TCP/NNTP TCP/HTTP TCP/HTTPS TCP/Gopher TCP/Telnet TCP/SSH TCP/POP TCP/IMAP TCP/DNS TCP/LPD TCP/Whois TCP/Rwhois
		TCP/NFS TCP/NFSv3 TCP/POPS TCP/IMAPS TCP/SMTPS TCP/NNTPS
		TCP/SIP<A HREF="#foot_6">[6]</A> TCP/Slimserver

	<LI>UDP/SNMP UDP/SNMPv2c<A HREF="#foot_7">[7]</A> UDP/SNMPv3<A HREF="#foot_5">[5]</A>
		UDP/DNS UDP/DNSQ<A HREF="#foot_1">[1]</A> UDP/NTP
		UDP/Portmap UDP/NFS
		UDP/NFSv3<A HREF="#foot_2">[2]</A>
		UDP/RADIUS<A HREF="#foot_3">[3]</A>
		UDP/SIP<A HREF="#foot_6">[6]</A>
		UDP/IAX2<A HREF="#foot_6">[6]</A>

	<LI>several "special" tests: TCP/URL UDP/Domain
		TCP/RPC<A HREF="#foot_6">[6]</A> UDP/RPC<A HREF="#foot_6">[6]</A>
</UL>

<H2>Common Data that applies to all Services</H2>
<PRE>
	Service NAME {
		frequency:	60
		retries:	5
		timeout:	10
	}
</PRE>
<P>These do not need to be specified, they will happily default, or propagate
from an enclosing group</P>
<UL>
<LI>	<P><TT>frequency</TT>	specifies how often the service is tested, in seconds.
	<BR>The author is aware that technically, this should be called <TT>period</TT>
	-- deal with it.</P>

<LI>	<P><TT>retries</TT>	if a test fails, we will retry it the specified
	number of times before declaring it down</P>

<LI>	<P><TT>timeout</TT>	how long to wait for something (eg. a response from
	a mail server) before giving up and declaring the test a failure.</P>
</UL>
<DIV CLASS=TECHNOTE>
Note, specifying that things happen every 60 seconds (for example) does not mean
that they will happen at the top of every minute (:00 seconds). Argus is smart
and will load balance the tests to prevent the 59 seconds of quiet followed by
an intense flurry of network congestion common in some other network monitoring
applications. In argus-speak, things have a frequency and a phase, called <TT>phi</TT>.
You cannot set this, but it is visible in the debugging web page.
</DIV>

<H2>Data for Prog Tests</H2>
<PRE>
	Service Prog {
		# make sure no one deleted root from the passwd file
		command:	cat /etc/passwd
		expect:		^root:
	}
</PRE>
<P>These need to be specified. They will not default, or propagate from anywhere</P>
<UL>
<LI>	<P><TT>command</TT>	the command to run, along with any commandline arguments.
	specify it just as you would to your shell. you should either specify a complete
	path to the program, or verify that it is in argus's PATH</P>
<LI>	<P><TT>expect</TT>	a regular expression that needs to match the output
	from the command. if not specified, the exit code from the program will be
	used to determine success or failure</P>
</UL>

<H2>Data for Ping Tests</H2>
<PRE>
	Service Ping {
		hostname:	host1.example.com
	}
</PRE>
<P>This needs to be specified, but will propagate from an enclosing group</P>
<P><TT>hostname</TT>	the hostname or IP address to ping</P>


<H2>Data for TCP and UDP Tests</H2>
<PRE>
	Service TCP {
		hostname:	www.example.com
		port:		80
		send:		HEAD / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n
		expect:		HTTP
		readhow:	toeof
	}
</PRE>
<P>Both TCP and UDP have many of the same parameters</P>
<UL>
<LI>	<P><TT>hostname</TT>	the hostname or IP address to test.
	This needs to be specified, but will propagate from an enclosing group</P>
<LI>	<P><TT>port</TT>	the port to test. This needs to be specified.</P>
<LI>	<P><TT>send</TT>	data to send once connected. This needs to be specified. If nothing
	is specified, nothing will be sent to the remote server</P>
<LI>	<P><TT>expect</TT>	a regular expression that needs to match the data received from the
	remote server. This needs to be specified. If nothing is specified, success or failure
	is determined by whether or not we received any data at all</P>
<LI>	<P><TT>readhow</TT>	This needs to be specified. How much data should we try to read?
	<TT>toeof</TT> indicates read until the remote end closes the connection. <TT>banner</TT>
	indicates we only want to read a banner. <TT>once</TT> indicates to use whatever data
	is returned in the first read(). This parameter only applies to TCP not UDP</P>
</UL>
<P>Specifying an application (eg. TCP/SMTP) will fill in port, send, expect, and readhow
as appropriate for that protocol</P>

<P>See below for details on the special <A HREF="#TCP/URL">TCP/URL</A>,
<A HREF="#UDP/Domain">UDP/Domain</A>,
and <A HREF="#UDP/SNMP">UDP/SNMP</A> tests</P>

<H2><A NAME="UDP/SNMP">SNMP Tests</A></H2>
<PRE>
	Service UDP/SNMP {

<LI>	<P><TT>community</TT>	the SNMP community. 
	This needs to be specified, but will propagate from an enclosing group</P>
<LI>	<P><TT>oid</TT>		the OID to query. It should be numeric, and the
	leading '.' is optional. This needs to be specified.</P>

<LI>	<P><TT>maxvalue</TT>	the maximum permitted value, if the query returns
	something larger, we consider the service down. You can specify any of:</P><UL>
		<LI>maxvalue

	</UL>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="UDP/SNMPv3">SNMPv3 Tests</A><A HREF="#foot_5">[5]</A></H2>

<PRE>
	Service UDP/SNMPv3 {
		hostname:	cisco-1.example.com

	}
</PRE>
<UL>
<LI>	<P><TT>snmpuser</TT>	the snmp username
	This needs to be specified, but will propagate from an enclosing group</P>
<LI>	<P><TT>snmppass</TT>	the snmp authentication password
	This needs to be specified if authentication is required, but will propagate from an enclosing group</P>

<LI>	<P><TT>authengine</TT>		the authentication engine-id
	This needs to be specified, but will propagate from an enclosing group,
	or will attempt to be auto-discovered.</P>

</UL>

<H3>SNMP rate calculations <A HREF="#foot_4">[4]</A></H3>
<P>Certain SNMP values are not useful themselves, but may be useful to watch
after performing some manipulation. InOctets by itself is not useful, but
using it to calculate a rate (or bandwidth use) in Bytes (or Bits) per second
and comparing that value to a max or min is useful.</P>
<PRE>
	Service UDP/SNMP {
		label:		Out
		hostname:       cisco-1.example.com
		# OutOctets
		oid:		.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16.2
		calc:		ave-rate-bits
		maxvalue:	20000000	# 20M bits/sec
		minvalue:	 1000000	#  1M bits/sec
	}
</PRE>
<P>This will convert the OutOctets value into a rate (Bytes per second),
calculate the moving average, and convert it to Bits per second. If the
resulting value falls outside the expected range of 1-20 Mbps, the test
will fail.</P>

<DIV CLASS=TECHNOTE>
The <TT>calc</TT> parameter was known as <TT>snmpcalc</TT> prior
to version 3.2</DIV>

<H2><A NAME="TCP/URL">TCP/URL Content Test</A></H2>
<P>The TCP/HTTP tests that the HTTP service is up and running. The TCP/URL test
will test the content of a web page.</P>
<PRE>
	Service TCP/URL {
		url:	 http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/shoppingcart.pl
		browser: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; just testing)
		expect:	 cart contains 1 item
	}
</PRE>
<UL>
<LI>	<P><TT>url</TT>		the url to fetch. it must begin with 'http://',
	and may contain an optional ':port'. It needs to be specified.</P>
<LI>	<P><TT>expect</TT>	a regular expression that needs to match the data received from the
	remote server. This needs to be specified. If nothing is specified, success or failure
	is determined by whether or not we received any data at all</P>
<LI>	<P><TT>browser</TT>	spoof the specified browser (send as the User-Agent). This
	is optional, and can be used if the server or application is serving different
	content based on browser.</P>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="UDP/Domain">DNS Authoritativeness Test</A></H2>
<P>The UDP/DNS (and UDP/DNSQ) test that a DNS server is up and running.
The UDP/Domain test will test that a server is answering authoritatively for a zone.</P>
<PRE>
	Service UDP/Domain {
		hostname:	ns1.example.com
		zone:		example.com
	}
</PRE>
<UL>
<LI>	<P><TT>hostname</TT>	the hostname or IP address to query.
	This needs to be specified, but will propagate from an enclosing group</P>
<LI>	<P><TT>zone</TT>	the DNS zone to check.
</UL>
<P>as a shortcut, an alternative syntax is supported:</P>
<PRE>
	Group "nameserver" {
		hostname:	ns1.example.com
		Service UDP/Domain/example.com
		Service UDP/Domain/example.net
		Service UDP/Domain/example.org
	}
</PRE>

<H2>RPC tests</H2>
<DIV CLASS=TECHNOTE>
RPC testing is available only in versions 3.4 and later
</DIV>

<P>Both TCP and UDP RPC services can be tested.
The RPC tests will query the RPC portmapper
to learn the service's current port.

	This needs to be specified, but will propagate from an enclosing group</P>
<LI>	<P><TT>prognum</TT>	the RPC program number. this must be specified.
				many common RPC services can also be specified by name.</P>
<LI>	<P><TT>version</TT>	the RPC program version. will default to 0.</P>
</UL>
<P>as a shortcut, an alternative syntax is supported:</P>
<PRE>

	Group "server" {
