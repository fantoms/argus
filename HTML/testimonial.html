I just want to take a few minutes to tell you what a great piece of software Argus is.  I have looked
and tested other open source monitoring applications(cricket/bigbrother/netsaint) and found Argus to
be the best in my opinion.  Installation and configuration was a breeze on my U60/solaris 8 monitoring
station, system load also seems lower than with the other mentioned packages. This thing is exactly
what I was looking for.
<BR>
Thanks for your time and for making such a great piece of code available to the general public.

I would like to tell you that Argus is exactly what I have been looking for in a monitoring app

First I like to say that I like you Argus project. I just installed
it and after some fiddling it works great, and does exacly what I want.

<DT>
First, thanks for writing something that seems to be clean and easy to
extend.  I have been using Nagios @ work for some time and am anxious to
replace it.

Very nice -- we're just starting to test Argus for a small monitoring
job, and so far it seems useful. Thanks for your contribution to the
open source community.

I am really happy with your soft, it is probably one of the best i have
never found! 
<BR>
I own a hosting and this tool has been really cool for my business :)

Argus works excellently. We use it to log data about all traffic through
our router so that we can produce bandwidth usage statistics for customers.

<DT>
This looks like a really great piece of
monitoring software and it works perfectly with what I have configured (I
already had qpage, apache, gd and perl installed for MRTG).
<BR>
Argus kicks ass!

First off, Great program.  It does 90% of what I was looking for...

Seems to be e great work. Thanks!

I've been testing out Argus, and I really like the product.

<DT>
I have to say.. compliments on Argus.  It truly is the worlds most advanced
monitoring system.
<DD>Jeremy Kister - broadviewnet.net<P>

<DT>
First off, congrats on a kick ass little app!

I've found Argus to be just the tool that I need to keep an eye on our
server facility.  I use it to monitor and report on 20 or so machines,
monitoring about 200 individual services.
<DD>Gaby Vanhegan - mediaworksccl.com<P>

<DT>
I really like what you're doing with Argus

My team at JP Morgan is evaluating argus for use as a monitoring system to 
replace our clunky in-house system. So far it looks great

<DT>
Thanks for creating Argus
<DD>Hub Dohmen - dohmen.nl<P>

<DT>
I check out your app. It looks really good.
<DD>John Wojcik - About.com<P>

<DT>
I start using Argus and I very happy. Thank you for Argus.

I wanted to first let you know how much I love this software.  I was really 
sweating this project I had... to set up monitoring software, but Argus made 
it a breeze.

We are using Argus in-house at RACQ to monitor our Sun
systems and some of the essential network gear.
It's darn good.
<DD>Joe McKinnon - racq.com.au<P>

<DT>
Last night I took the time to switch my own network over from
Nagios and Demarc to Argus and I have to say "It kicks ass".  I don't
really have it monitoring everything yet and I haven't even touched the
surface of features but within 15-20 minutes I was up and running on
FreeBSD versus 2 days for a propper installation of Nagios.
<DD>Scott Hiemstra<P>

<DT>I installed your program, and i like it ;-)
<DD>Honti Miklos - miki.hu<P>

<DT>
Started using argus a couple of weeks ago -- GREAT software!
<DD>Zach Berke - twotacos.com<P>

<DT>
Argus is a great product, you have all my thanks for the excellent job you did.

Having Argus has to have been the single best career move
yet. 100% uptime is difficult to impossible, but 100%
PERCEIVED uptime is entirely possible with Argus. Now I
know when a service is down long before the boss does. So
customizable, I'm able to monitor damn near anything on
any level. Perfect.
<DD>eleqtric<P>

Argus is absolutely brilliant. I wasted an entire day playing around with
broken, convoluted, piece of crap monitoring daemons, and then I found
Argus and all was better. What I liked just as much as Argus was the
well-written, informative, and amusing documentation. 
<DD>Neil Anderson - psiframe.com<P>

<DT>
i am just getting into argus but i have evaluated, and dumped, a couple
other service monitoring apps  - and argus looks great.
<DD>george donnelly - zettai.net<P>

<DT>
THANK YOU so much for Argus!
I was going bananas for the last 2 days trying to configure Nagios, and 
I got Argus up and running in less than one hour.
I'm testing it on an old Sun Sparc64 running NetBSD 2.0, and it's 
running just perfect :)
