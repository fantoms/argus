	I downloaded argus, but I think it is corrupt. I try to unzip
	it, but I just get an error <FONT COLOR=blue>Error reading header. Zip file corrupt.</FONT>

</B></P>
<P>
	It is not a zip file. It is a tgz file.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD><P><A NAME="">5.</A> <B>
	I get all sort of permission denied errors from the cgi program,
	how should I have permission set on the various items in the datadir?
</B></P>
<P>
	The datadir and auth file and control socket need to be writable by the
	www user (or whatever user/group your web server runs as). <BR>
	The log, user and html/* files need to be readable by the www user
	and writable by the argus user (or whatever user argusd runs as).<BR>
	The notno, notify/*, and stats/* need to be writable by the argus user.
	<BR>
	There is, of course, more than one way to do this, but one way:
	<FONT COLOR=blue><PRE>
		ls -lF $datadir
		drwxr-xr-x  6 www          512 Oct 19 12:32 ./
		-rw-r--r--  1 www        32768 Oct 20 11:37 auth
		drwxr-xr-x  2 argus	   512 Sep 20 13:18 config/
		srw-rw-rw-  1 argus	     0 Oct 19 12:31 control=
		drwxr-xr-x  2 argus	  4608 Oct 20 11:37 html/
		-rw-r--r--  1 argus	151033 Oct 19 12:31 log
		drwxr-xr-x  2 argus	 18944 Oct 20 11:30 notify/
		-rw-r--r--  1 argus	     5 Oct 20 11:30 notno
		drwxr-xr-x  2 argus	 52224 Oct  3 11:10 stats/
		-rw-r--r--  1 argus	   134 Sep 20 15:25 users
	</PRE></FONT>

	<P>
	Or, the short answer:<BR>
	in your argus config, add
	<FONT COLOR=blue><PRE>
		chmod_control:	777
	</PRE></FONT>
	and, do the following
	<FONT COLOR=blue><PRE>
		prompt % cd $datadir
		prompt % chmod -R a+rw .
	</PRE></FONT>
	replacing <TT>$datadir</TT> with the actual directory.
	wait for argusd to reload the config file, and try again.

	How can I monitor HTTP on a particular host on port 80/tcp and also HTTP on
	the same host on port 8080/tcp?<BR>
	Argus does not like you if you add:
	<FONT COLOR=blue><PRE>
		Host "jeremy-03.example.com" {
			Service TCP/HTTP
			Service TCP/HTTP {
				port: 8080
			}
		}
	</PRE></FONT>

</B></P>
<P>
	It doesn't work because Argus requires objects to have unique names,
	so it can tell them apart. In the above example both objects will
	have the name <FONT COLOR=blue>HTTP_jeremy-03.example.com</FONT>. <BR>
	You can override the default name Argus uses to identify objects:
	<FONT COLOR=blue><PRE>
		Host "jeremy-03.example.com" {
			Service TCP/HTTP {
				uname: HTTP-PRIMARY
			}
			Service TCP/HTTP {
				port:  8080
				uname: HTTP-SECONDARY
			}

	I want argus to notify me about DOWN events, but not about UP events.
	Is there some syntax I can use to do this?

</B></P>
<P>
	If you set the <FONT COLOR=blue>messageup</FONT> or <FONT COLOR=blue>messagedn</FONT>
	parameter to the empty string, then that message will not be sent.

	Instead of the 'Oodles of stuff just came up' or 'Tons of stuff just
	went down' emails, can I get an email that lists exactly what happened?

</B></P>
<P>
	Normally, Argus tries to conserve your sanity, and not blast you
	with thousands of email messages. But, you can control this.
	<BR>
	If you set <FONT COLOR=blue>nolotsmsgs: yes</FONT> you will receive
	one email listing each thing that went up or down.
	<BR>
	If you set <FONT COLOR=blue>qtime: 0</FONT> every message will sent
	separately, nothing will be summarized.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD><P><A NAME="">11.</A> <B>
	How can I change the subject lines of emails argus send me?

</B></P>
<P>
	Add to your config:
	<pre>
	Method "mail" {
		command:	sendmail -t
		send:		To: %R\nFrom:%F\nSubject: Argus %E\n\n%M\n
	}

	edit as desired.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD><P><A NAME="">12.</A> <B>
	I am trying to monitor a djbdns server using UDP/DNS and it always
	shows as down. It appears to work when I test it manually. What to do?
</B></P>
<P>
	The UDP/DNS test sends a DNS 'status' query, which is ignored
	by djbdns. Use the UDP/DNSQ test or a UDP/Domain test instead.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD><P><A NAME="">13.</A> <B>
	How can I monitor my DHCP server?

</B></P>
<P>
	The DHCP protocol is a real bugger. Currently, Argus cannot
	monitor it directly. Some Argus users have had success setting
	Argus up to run the program 'dhcping':<BR>
	<A HREF="http://freshmeat.net/branches/14698/">DHCP Ping Freshmeat Page</A>
	<BR>
	This program does require being installed setuid root and has some
	limitations, so it may not work in all environments.

	I am trying to use the UDP/RADIUS test to check my radius server,
	but it always shows as down. What can I do?
</B></P>
<P>
	Argus uses the RADIUS server-status extension for testing, this
	is not supported by all radius servers. It is known to work with:
	<FONT COLOR=blue><PRE>
	merit radius
	radiator
	cistron radius 1.6.5 and later
	free radius 0.8 and later (set server_status = yes in the config)
	gnu radius Sep/2003 and later

	If I modify a config file, what is the best way to let argus
	know it needs to reload it?
</B></P>
<P>
	Argus checks all of the config files every several minutes, and
	will automatically reload if one changes.<P>
	If you are impatient, you can run <TT>argusctl hup</TT>

	What is the best way to shut argus down? Should I just kill it?

	I have a particular server which is down at the same time every day
	for maintenance. I do not want to be notified about this. Is there
	a way I can handle this?
</B></P>
<P>
	In version 3.7 and later, you can use the following
	in your config file:

	<FONT COLOR=blue><PRE>
	Service TCP/HTTP {
                Schedule checking {
                        * 0400 - 1000 => no
                }

	I keep seeing:
	<FONT COLOR=blue>Sep 11 06:18:26 pluto.example.com sendmail[2665]: NOQUEUE: pluto.example.com
	[10.0.0.1] did not issue MAIL/EXPN/VRFY/ETRN during connection to MTA</FONT>
	in my sendmail log. What is this?

</B></P>
<P>
	New versions of sendmail log every connection that does not issue valid
	mail transfer commands. The author recommends that you ignore the message.<BR>
	If you to issue a valid MAIL command, you would still get entries in your log
	file (but different messages).<BR>
	If the message really bothers you, and you don't mind breaking the protocol,
	the author has noticed that sendmail does not log syntax errors:
	<FONT COLOR=blue><PRE>
			Service TCP/SMTP {
				send:	MAIL\r\n
			}

	silly, silly, sendmail developers...

	Can I get on a mailing list to learn about new versions of the software

</B></P>
<P>
	Yes, see the link to the left.

	Or, you can configure freshmeat to notify you of updates, by subscribing
	to the <A HREF="http://freshmeat.net/projects/argus-tas">Argus Freshmeat Project</A>. Read the

	Another monitoring application includes a feature that lets
	me get a random quotation by clicking a button, such as:
	<FONT COLOR=blue><PRE>
		"It was as true as taxes is. And nothing's truer than them." 
		Charles Dickens (1812-1870)
	</PRE></FONT>
	How can I get argus to do this?
</B></P>

	Why on earth do you want a monitoring application to provide
	random quotations?

	Argus appears to be working correctly, but when I run <TT>ps</TT>
	I see <B>2</B> argus daemons running. Is this normal?
</B></P>
<P>
	Yes. One does all of the monitoring, etc. The other exists
	to monitor the other one
	and restart the first one if/when it exits.<P>
	If you have graphing enabled, there will be an additional
	process to save graphing data. If you have database testing
	enabled, there may be additional processes communicating
	with the databases.

	I use qmail. How can I get argus to send me email?
</B></P>
<P>
	The program "sendmail" that comes with qmail is fully
	compatible with argus. Make sure argus discovers the correct
	path during Configure (you can edit the Makefile if needed).
	(typically, it is installed in '/var/qmail/bin/').
	It will just work.

	I have argus monitoring all of my stuff, but I worry
	that by monitoring from inside my own network, I will
	not be able to detect problems outside of my network
	that could cause problems. What can I do?

</B></P>
<P>
	Monitoring from several different locations is a highly
	recommended part of a well balanced monitoring archetecture.
	<P>
	There are a number of companies that can augment your
	internal monitoring by monitoring your systems from
	outside of your network, such as:<BR>
