		the standard fping will only do IPv4. the fping
		from fping.com can be compiled to do either v4
		or v6, it cannot do both in one binary. you must
		install one fping for v4 and one for v6.</P>
	<LI>	an operating system with IPv6 support.
</UL>

<H2>Configuring</H2>
<P>Basically, do nothing.</P>
<P>If the address you specify is an IPv6 address, or resolves
to an IPv6 address, IPv6 will be used. There is nothing
to configure differently.
</P>

<H2>IPv4 or IPv6</H2>
<p>If you specify a <span class=param>hostname</span> that has both A and AAAA records,
by default, argus will try the IPv4 address first, and if it is unreachable,
switch to the IPv6 addresses. You can tell argus to use only IPv4, only IPv6,
or a preferred order using the <span class=param>ipversion</span> parameter:
<pre>
        ipversion:      4
        ipversion:      6
        ipversion:      4 6
        ipversion:      6 4
</pre>
<DIV CLASS=TECHNOTE>
the <span class=param>ipversion</span> parameter was added in version 3.7
</DIV>
